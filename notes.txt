##### Notes from Yiming Li
##### The repo: https://github.com/kestrel614/HKODD17-Trump

### R scripts dependency
### Currently a bit messed up. Would clean this later.

cleanData.R (requires the two csv files; creates tweets.RData and tweets2.RData) -> wordCloud.R (requires tweets2.RData; creates tweets3.RData, trumpcloud.pdf and ivankacloud.pdf)

basicVis.R (requires the two csv files; creates tweets-basicVis.RData and TrumpBasicVis.pdf) -> sentAnalysis.R (not yet implemented; possibly requires tweets-basicVis.RData)

### For the write-up

Mainly basicVis.R and TrumpBasicVis.pdf. The pdf file contains the graphs, whereas the last several lines of basicVis.R contains some description of the visualization.

For the old results presented in the hackathon, please c.f. cleanData.R and the two word cloud PDFs.
